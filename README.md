# Book-Recommendation-System

This project presents the development of a book recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system was implemented using Pyspark, an open-source big data processing framework, and the ALS(Alternating Least Square) model was used to make recommendations. The backend database used was PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system. The developed system was integrated into a website, allowing users to interact with the recommendation system and receives personalized book recommendations based on their preferences. The webisite provides a user-friendly interface for users to search for books and view their recommendations.
The project focused on improving the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations by incorporating user feedback and improving the data quality. 
The system was evaluated using various performance metrics, such as RMSE(Root mean square error) and achived satisfactory results.
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in developing personalized book recommendation system and provides a practical solution for book enthusiasts looking for relevant and personalized book recommendations.
